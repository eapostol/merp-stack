# This file contains the GraphQL schema definition for the application.
# It defines the types, queries, and mutations that can be performed on the data.
# The schema is used by the GraphQL server to understand the structure of the
# data and how to interact with it.
# This file is equivalent to typeDefs.ts in the Apollo Server setup.
